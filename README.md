## My ReadAgent Implementation

This is my own implementation of a ReadAgent, inspired by the original work ([https://read-agent.github.io/](https://read-agent.github.io/)). 

**Key Features:**

* **Custom Content Breaking Strategies:** I've implemented various strategies for breaking down content, allowing for more efficient processing.
* **Unlimited Context Length:** By utilizing a sliding window approach, my implementation overcomes context length limitations.
